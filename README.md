datetime_tz module
===============================================================================

A version of the python-datetime module which deeply cares about timezone
(instead of ignoring the problem). The module automatically detects your
current timezone using a variety of different methods.

The module also includes extra functionality;

 * Full integration with pytz (just give it the string of the timezone!)
 * Proper support for going to/from Unix timestamps (which are in UTC!).
 * Smart Parsing which attempts to accept all formats.

This module depends on:

 * pytz - For providing the Timezone database.
 * dateutil - For providing parsing of many common formats.

For development:
 * PyLint - Needed for checking for link.
 * Genshi - Needed for building windows mapping file.
